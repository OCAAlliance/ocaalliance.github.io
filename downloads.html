      <h2>OCA Microdemo</h2>
      <p>
        The OCA Microdemo is a demonstration product developed by OCA Alliance members. Its
        primary purpose is to prove that OCA can run well in lightweight hardware environments.
        The MicroDemo meets minimum requirements for AES70 compliance, and provides a small
        set of OCA-controlled application functions as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The custom software, finished schematic diagrams, and PC board layouts, for the MicroDemo are publicly available at no charge, on commercially appropriate licensing terms.
        Please review the OCA Alliance End User License Agreement (<a href='http://ocaalliance.com/eula/'>EULA</a>) prior to downloading and using these tools.

      <h2>OCA.js JavaScript library</h2>
      
      <p>
        OCA.js is a javascript library that supports OCA. It can be used for building web-based OCA
        device controllers. It's an open-source component developed by OCA Alliance member
        DeusO, and is available on GitHub here:

      <h2>AES70 Implementation Chart</h2>

      <p>
        The AES70 Implementation Chart is an Excel spreadsheet template that offers a standard way for documenting the OCA objects of a device.
	It is similar in purpose to the "MIDI Implementation Chart" pages frequently found in user manuals of MIDI-controlled devices.
        The AES70 Implementation chart is not part of the AES70 standard itself, but instead a recommended practice offered by the OCA Alliance.
