			<h2>AES70 Compliancy Test Tool (OCTT)</h2>
			
			<p>
				The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool, aka OCTT, is an open-source Windows program for testing 
				devices' conformance to the minimum AES70 implementation specification defined in Part 2 
				of the AES70 standard.  
				OCTT is a programmer's tool designed specifically to confirm that the AES70 protocol interface of a 
				device under development fulfills the minimum requirements for AES70 compliance.
				It is not a complete conformance test tool.
			</p>
			<p>
				OCTT supports both AES70-2015 and AES70-2018 devices.  
				It is driven by an XML control file that users may extend to add their own specific tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				OCTT is a free open-source offering available to all.  
				No OCA Alliance membership is required, and there are no commercially difficult licensing conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Architecturally, OCTT is an AES70 controller.  
				Hence, its source code may be a useful starting point for development of commercial AES70 controllers.

      <h2>OCA Microdemo</h2>
			
      <p>
        The OCA Microdemo is a demonstration product developed by OCA Alliance members. Its
        primary purpose is to prove that OCA can run well in lightweight hardware environments.
        The MicroDemo meets minimum requirements for AES70 compliance, and provides a small
        set of OCA-controlled application functions as well.
        The custom software, finished schematic diagrams, and PC board layouts, for the MicroDemo are publicly available at no charge, on commercially appropriate licensing terms.
        Please review the OCA Alliance End User License Agreement 
        (<a href='http://ocaalliance.com/eula/'>EULA</a>) 
        prior to downloading and using these tools.

      <h2>Focusrite RedNet Virtual OCA Device</h2>

      <p>
        The Focusrite RedNet Virtual OCA Device is a device simulation developed by 
				<a rel=noopener target=_blank href='http://focusrite.com'>
					Focusrite
				</a>.
        It is useful when testing OCA Controllers.
        The device simulation is available as a Windows executable.

      <h2>AES70.js JavaScript library</h2>
      
      <p>
        AES70.js is a javascript library that implements AES70.  
				Based on Node.js, it can be used for building OCA device controllers that run in browser environments. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				AES70.js is an open-source component developed by OCA Alliance member DeusO. It is available on github at
        (<a rel=noopener target=_blank href='https://github.com/DeutscheSoft/AES70.js'>https://github.com/DeutscheSoft/AES70.js</a>)
        and as an NPM package at
        (<a rel=noopener target=_blank href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/aes70'>https://www.npmjs.com/package/aes70</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>AES70 Implementation Chart</h2>

      <p>
        The AES70 Implementation Chart is an Excel spreadsheet template that offers a standard way for documenting the OCA objects of a device.
				It is similar in purpose to the "MIDI Implementation Chart" pages frequently found in user manuals of MIDI-controlled devices.
        The AES70 Implementation chart is not part of the AES70 standard itself, but instead a recommended practice offered by the OCA Alliance.

      <h2>OCA Wireshark Legacy Plugin</h2>

      <p>
        <a rel=noopener target=_blank href='https://wireshark.org/'>Wireshark</a> is a widely used network protocol analyzer. Beginning with Wireshark 4.0, an OCA plugin is included in its standard distribution. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For Wireshark versions before 4.0, this plugin allows analyzing OCA network traffic.

			<h2> OCA for Video Devices - An Experimental Specification </h2>
			
			<p class="loose">
				Although not originally designed for video devices, 
				much of OCA is general enough that video device control is possible.
				In the future, specific video classes will be added to OCA.
			</p>
			<p class="loose">
				As an experiment, we have drafted a partial OCA control model for a modern HD/4K production
				video camera from a major broadcast equipment manufacturer.  This model is presented in the 
				download, a six-slide presentation.
