			<h1> Licensing </h1>
			<p>
				This page describes the OCA Alliance's licensing policies and procedures for open-source projects.  
				The Alliance uses Apache Foundation licenses, which cover
				a wide range of intellectual-property issues, including patent rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apache licenses do <b>not</b> have copy-left requirements, and are widely accepted
				for commercial use.
			</p>
			<h2>License for Use</h1>
			<p class="tight">
				OCA Alliance open-source products are licensed for use under the <b>Apache License, Version 2.0</b>, 
				and may not be used except in compliance with this license. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A copy of this license, including instructions for use, is on the Apache website, here:

      <p>
          This license does not require signing; 
          Any OCA open-source product may be used without executing an agreement.
          However, by using such a product, the user implicitly accepts the terms of this license.
      </p>
       
			<h2 id="CLA"> Contributor License Agreements </h1>
            
      <p>
        Contributor License Agreements define the terms under which intellectual property 
        has been contributed to the project. With proper Contributor License Agreements in place, 
        the OCA Alliance can defend a project, should there be a legal dispute regarding its software. 
      </p>  
      
      <p>
        Unlike the license for use described in the previous section, Contributor License Agreements
        must be individually signed and submitted to the OCA Alliance.  
        The policies and process for this are described below.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        There are two kinds of Contributor License Agreement - <b>Individual</b> and <b>Corporate</b>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="ICLA"> Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) </h2>
      
      <p>
        Every individual who contributes ideas, code, or documentation to any OCA Alliance open-source 
        project must submit a completed and signed 
        <a href="licensing/OCA Alliance ICLA.pdf" target="_blank">
            <b>Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)</b>
        </a>
        to the Alliance.  
        An individual must have submitted such an ICLA to the Alliance before commit rights 
        are granted to any Alliance open-source repository.
      </p>

      <p>  
        The OCA Alliance ICLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ICLA version 2.2. 
        The  Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities.
      </p>

      <p>
        An ICLA need be submitted only once per individual.  Once the submission is accepted, 
        the individual is potentially authorized to contribute to any Alliance project.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="CCLA"> Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) </h2>
      
      <p>
        A corporation that assigns employees to work on an OCA Alliance project may optionally 
        submit a completed and signed 
        <a href="licensing/OCA Alliance CCLA.pdf" target="_blank">
            <b>Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)</b>
        </a>
        to the Alliance.
        By so doing, the corporation provides a clear legal basis for the submission of corporate 
        intellectual property to the project. 
      </p>
      
      <p>  
        The OCA Alliance CCLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) CCLA version r190612. 
        The Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When a corporation has submitted a CCLA, any of its employees who wishes to contribute 
        must still submit a signed ICLA, in order to cover both contributions the corporation 
        signing the CCLA owns, <b>and</b> those it does not own. 
      </p>
     
      <p>
        A CCLA need be submitted only once per corporation.  Once the submission is accepted, 
        it will apply to the corporation's contributions to any Alliance project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so a person with authority to enter into 
        legal contracts on behalf of the corporation must sign it.  
      </p>
      
      <h3> Submission Instructions </h2>

        Documents may be signed by hand or by electronic signature.  
        In either case, begin by filling in the form with a PDF viewer,
        then perform one of the two following steps:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt">  
          Print the document, sign it, and scan all pages into a single PDF file; <b> or </b> 
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt">
          Use a PDF viewer that supports digital signing (for example, Adobe Acrobat or, 
          in MacOSX and Apple iOS, the built-in PDF viewer) to sign the document digitally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Email the signed document to <b>ossadmin@ocaalliance.com</b> .
      </p>
      <p>
        The Alliance does not accept submissions by other delivery means.
