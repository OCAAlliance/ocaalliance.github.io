# Contribution

All contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the AES70-library project must complete, sign, and submit via email an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://ocaalliance.github.io/licensing/OCA%20Alliance%20ICLA.pdf) (ICLA). The ICLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ICLA version 2.2. The adaptation solely consists of changes to the names of the legal entities.

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the project and thereby allows the OCA Alliance to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software. An individual must have submitted a signed ICLA to the OCA Alliance before commit rights are granted to the project.

For a corporation that assigns employees to work on the AES70-library project, a [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://ocaalliance.github.io/licensing/OCA%20Alliance%20CCLA.pdf) (CCLA) is available. The CCLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) CCLA version r190612. The adaptation solely consists of changes to the names of the legal entities. Note that a CCLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions the corporation signing the CCLA owns, and those it does not own. The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation must sign it.

You may sign documents by hand or by electronic signature, and submit them by email. The OCA Alliance does not accept submissions by postal mail or fax.

Please fill in the form with a PDF viewer and then follow one of these steps to create a signed copy:

- Print the document, sign it, and scan all pages into a single PDF file. OR
- Use a PDF viewer like Adobe Acrobat (or on MacOSX and Apple iOS the built-in PDF viewer) to digitally sign the document and save the signed version.

The signed document can be sent to [licensing@ocaalliance.com](mailto:licensing@ocaalliance.com).

Please note that typing your name in the field at the bottom of the document is not signing, regardless of the font that you use. A valid signature is any of the following:

- Writing your signature by hand on a printed copy of the document
- Digitally signing the document by hand-drawing a signature
- Signing the document via DocuSign. Adobe Reader implements this.

Unsigned documents are not accepted.
