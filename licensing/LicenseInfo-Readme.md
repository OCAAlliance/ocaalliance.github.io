*Contributor License Agreements*

Every individual who contributes ideas, code, or documentation to any OCA Alliance open-source project must submit a completed and signed Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) to the Alliance for approval. An individual must have an approved ICLA before commit rights are granted to any Alliance open-source repository.

The OCA Alliance ICLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ICLA version 2.2. The Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities.

An ICLA need be submitted only once per individual. Once the submission is accepted, the individual is potentially authorized to contribute to any Alliance project.

*Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)*

A corporation that assigns employees to work on an OCA Alliance project may optionally submit a completed and signed Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) to the Alliance. By so doing, the corporation provides a clear legal basis for the submission of corporate intellectual property to the project.

The OCA Alliance CCLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) CCLA version r190612. The Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities.

When a corporation has submitted a CCLA, any of its employees who wishes to contribute must still submit a signed ICLA, in order to cover both contributions the corporation signing the CCLA owns, and those it does not own.

A CCLA need be submitted only once per corporation. Once the submission is accepted, it will apply to the corporation's contributions to any Alliance project.

The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation must sign it.
