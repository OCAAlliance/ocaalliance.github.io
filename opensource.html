			<h1> Open-Source Software (OSS) Guidelines </h1>
			<p>
				This page is a quick guide for users of and contributors to OCA Alliance 
				open-source software.
			</p>
	
			<h2>Alliance open-source products </h2>
			<p>
				An Alliance open-source product is a software component or system the Alliance 
				publishes to help companies use AES70, the Audio Engineering Society's OCA standard
				for audio device control and monitoring over networks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Going forward, the Alliance will offer a growing number of open-source products to
				assist AES70 evaluation, experimentation, education, demonstration, and commercial
				implementation.
			</p>

				<h3> Open-source repository structure </h3>

			<h3>Contributing to an open-source project</h3>
			<p>
				Anyone may contribute to an Alliance open source project by submitting a Git Pull request
				to the project's repository.  No prior authorization is required.

				must contain a brief text that certifies the contributed content complies
				with the terms of the 
				<b><a href="https://developercertificate.org/">Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a></b>,
				a simple document written by the Linux Foundation that attests the contributor
				has sufficient rights to make the contribution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pull requests without DCO certifications will not be accepted by the Repository Manager,
				and should be resubmitted with certification included.
			</p>
			<p>
				The required text is as follows:	
			</p>
			<div class="in">
				<font face="Courier New" size=-1><b>

					the Linux Developer Certificate of Origin, the text of which is at
					https://developercertificate.org/. &lt;Submitter's full name and email&gt;
