			<h1> Open-Source Software (OSS) Guidelines </h1>
			<p>
				This page is a quick guide for users of and contributors to OCA Alliance 
				open-source software.
			</p>
	
			<h2>Alliance open-source products </h2>
			<p>
				An Alliance open-source product is a software component or system the Alliance 
				publishes to help companies use AES70, the Audio Engineering Society's OCA standard
				for audio device control and monitoring over networks.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Going forward, the Alliance will offer a growing number of open-source products to
				assist AES70 evaluation, experimentation, education, demonstration, and commercial
				implementation.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Finding Alliance open-source products</h3>
			<p>
				All Alliance open-source products are listed in various entries of the
				<a href="downloads.html" target="_blank"> Downloads </a> section of this website.
			</p>
	
			<p> Physically, Alliance open-source products are in GitHub repositories that reside in
				subfolders of the OCA Alliance's Github site, 
				<a href="https://ocaalliance.github.io/" target="_blank"">ocaalliance.github.io</a>.
			</p>
	
			<h3> Using Alliance open-source products </h3>
			<p>
				Alliance open-source products are licensed under the 
				<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank"> Apache 2.0 license </a>.
				You may use reproduce, modify, and/or redistribute any Allliance open-source product
				according to the terms of this license.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				For complete licensing details, please go to  
				<a href ='licensing.html'>Licensing</a> below.
			</p>
	
			<h3> Contributing to Alliance open-source projects </h3>
			<p>
				<b>Contributions to Alliance open-source projects are welcome</b>. 
				To make a contribution, the contributor posts a git pull-request to the
				product's GitHub repository. Once the repository manager approves it,
				the pull-request will be merged into the product.
			</p>
			<p>	
				To become a contributor, an individual must first sign an 
				<a href="licensing.html#ICLA">
					Individual Contributor License Agreement
				</a> 
				and submit it to the Alliance. 
				Once the individual's submission is accepted, they can contribute to any Alliance open-source project.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					In addition, a company whose employees contribute corporate intellectual property 
					to an Alliance open-source project should sign a
				<a href="licensing.html#CCLA">
						Corporate Contributor License Agreement
					</a>
				and submit it to the Alliance. 
				Once a company's CCLA is accepted, its employees can contribute to any Alliance open-source project.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Detailed procedures for signing and submitting Contributor License agreements are in the 
					 Licensing section of this website,
					 <a href ='licensing.html#CLA'>here</a> 
				</p>

				<h2> Technical Details </h2>
				<h3> Open-source repository structure </h3>
				
				<p>

				</p>
	
				<div class="in">
					<font size=4em color=DarkBlue>
					<pre style="text-align:left" class="tight">
<u><b>Folder or File		Contents		</b></u>

				</div>

				<h3>README file</h3>
				<p class="tight">

			<h2> Licensing Details </h2>
			<p>
				This page describes the OCA Alliance's licensing policies and procedures for open-source projects.  
				The Alliance uses Apache Foundation licenses, which cover
				a wide range of intellectual-property issues, including patent rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apache licenses do <b>not</b> have copy-left requirements, and are widely accepted
				for commercial use.
			</p>
			<h3>License for Use</h3>
			<p class="tight">
				OCA Alliance open-source products are licensed for use under the <b>Apache License, Version 2.0</b>, 
				and may not be used except in compliance with this license. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A copy of this license, including instructions for use, is on the Apache website, here:
			</p>
			<div class="in">
				<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">

      </div>
			
      <p>
          This license does not require signing; 
          Any OCA open-source product may be used without executing an agreement.
          However, by using such a product, the user implicitly accepts the terms of this license.
      </p>
       
			<h3 id="CLA"> Contributor License Agreements </h3>
            
      <p>
        Contributor License Agreements define the terms under which intellectual property 
        has been contributed to the project. With proper Contributor License Agreements in place, 
        the OCA Alliance can defend a project, should there be a legal dispute regarding its software. 
      </p>  
      
      <p>
        Unlike the license for use described in the previous section, Contributor License Agreements
        must be individually signed and submitted to the OCA Alliance.  
        The policies and process for this are described below.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        There are two kinds of Contributor License Agreement - <b>Individual</b> and <b>Corporate</b>.
      </p>
			
			<ul>
      
				<li>
					<h4 id="ICLA" class="tight"> Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) </h4>
					
					<p>
						Every individual who contributes ideas, code, or documentation to any OCA Alliance open-source 
						project must submit a completed and signed 
						<a href="licensing/OCA Alliance ICLA.pdf" target="_blank">
								<b>Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)</b>
						</a>
						to the Alliance.  
						An individual must have submitted such an ICLA to the Alliance before commit rights 
						are granted to any Alliance open-source repository.
					</p>

					<p>  
						The OCA Alliance ICLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ICLA version 2.2. 
						The  Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities.
					</p>

					<p>
						An ICLA need be submitted only once per individual.  Once the submission is accepted, 
						the individual is potentially authorized to contribute to any Alliance project.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				<h4 id="CCLA" class="tight"> Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) </h4>
				
				<p>
						A corporation that assigns employees to work on an OCA Alliance project may optionally 
						submit a completed and signed 
						<a href="licensing/OCA Alliance CCLA.pdf" target="_blank">
								<b>Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)</b>
						</a>
						to the Alliance.
						By so doing, the corporation provides a clear legal basis for the submission of corporate 
						intellectual property to the project. 
					</p>
					
					<p>  
						The OCA Alliance CCLA is based on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) CCLA version r190612. 
						The Alliance version changes only the names of the legal entities. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When a corporation has submitted a CCLA, any of its employees who wishes to contribute 
						must still submit a signed ICLA, in order to cover both contributions the corporation 
						signing the CCLA owns, <b>and</b> those it does not own. 
					</p>
				 
					<p>
						A CCLA need be submitted only once per corporation.  Once the submission is accepted, 
						it will apply to the corporation's contributions to any Alliance project.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so a person with authority to enter into 
						legal contracts on behalf of the corporation must sign it.  
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
      
      <h4> Submission Instructions </h4>
      
      <p>
        Download links for fillable ICLA and CCLA PDFs are as follows (click to view and download):
      </p>
      <ul >
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt"> 
          <a href="licensing/OCA Alliance ICLA.pdf" target="_blank"> 
            <b>ICLA</b> 
          </a> 
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt"> 
          <a href="licensing/OCA Alliance CCLA.pdf" target="_blank"> 
            <b>CCLA</b> 
          </a> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Documents may be signed by hand or by electronic signature.  
        In either case, begin by filling in the form with a PDF viewer,
        then perform one of the two following steps:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt">  
          Print the document, sign it, and scan all pages into a single PDF file; <b> or </b> 
        </li>
        
        <li style="margin-bottom:6pt">
          Use a PDF viewer that supports digital signing (for example, Adobe Acrobat or, 
          in MacOSX and Apple iOS, the built-in PDF viewer) to sign the document digitally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Email the signed document to 
					<a href="mailto:licensing@ocaalliance.com">
						<b>licensing@ocaalliance.com</b>
					</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Alliance does not accept submissions by other delivery means.
